# The Great Recovery


## Copy, paste, and post:

{% hint style="success" %}
When we get through the sickness, we will be even stronger. Get ready for the #GreatRecovery. \#coco
{% endhint %}

## Why This is Important:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Helping people understand that WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS. Because this is a global pandemic, it will likely be followed by a global recovery. \[Source: [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/outbreak-communication-best-practices-for-communicating-with-the-public-during-an-outbreak)\]
{% endhint %}

## Shoot a video:

_No fancy set. No hair and makeup. No need to memorize. Just turn the camera on yourself \(in landscape mode\) and read one of these lines:_

* This is \[NAME\] reminding you that there's no going back to life before \#Coronavirus, but the \#NewNormal might just be better than the Old Normal. Now take this message and pass it on: spread the word, not the germ 
* \[NAME\] here, reminding you to find a \#NewNormal. We're not going back to the old way, so do your best to get into a new routine. Now take this message and pass it on: spread the word, not the germ 
* This is \[NAME\]. _\[Share anything that shows how you are personally developing a new routine, developing new habits, or creating your own \#NewNormal.\]_ Spread the word, not the germ.

## PLEASE NOTE:

Avoid complaining about something that annoys you and tagging it \#NewNormal, unless that's really the way you want things to be.

## Use this hashtag:

{% hint style="success" %}
\#NewNormal
{% endhint %}

## Additional Notes:

* To be deployed in all global regions ASAP.
* Need translators to communicate this message locally. \[See [How to Help](../how-to-help.md)\]
