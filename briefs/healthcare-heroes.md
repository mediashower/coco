## Shoot a video:

_No fancy set. No hair and makeup. No need to memorize. Just turn the camera on yourself \(in landscape mode\) and read one of these lines:_

* Hi, this is \[NAME\] reminding you that our \#HealthcareHeroes are the first responders in the fight against \#Coronavirus. Find ways to support them, even if it's just a quick thank you. Now take this message and pass it on: spread the word, not the germ. 
* This is \[NAME\]. Our \#HealthcareHeroes are literally putting their lives on the line. Find a way to support them: equipment, food, or a phone call. Now take this message and pass it on: spread the word, not the germ. 
* This is \[NAME\] and I want to remind you that everyone can support our Healthcare Heroes in some way: bring them food, say thanks, donate blood. What can YOU do? Think about it, then pass along this message: spread the word, not the germ. 
* Hi, this is \[NAME\]. Healthcare Heroes are literally saving the world from \#Coronavirus. Doctors, nurses, admins, EMTs, insurance workers: THANK YOU! Now take this message and pass it on: spread the word, not the germ. 
* Ths is \[NAME\] reminding you to HELP OUR HEALTHCARE HEROES. Find some small way to contribute to the healthcare effort today. Find some way to do a \#CoCo in the global healthcare effort. Now take this message and pass it on: spread the word, not the germ.
