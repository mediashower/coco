* Hi, I'm \[NAME\]. We are trying to SLOW THE SPREAD of \#Coronavirus to help our Healthcare Heroes treat more sick, more slowly. Now take this message and pass it on: spread the word, not the germ. 
* Hi, this is \[NAME\]. When you practice social distancing, you don't just protect yourself, you protect others. This SLOWS THE SPREAD of \#Coronavirus and helps our Healthcare Heroes. Take this message and pass it on: spread the word, not the germ.

* Hey everyone, I'm \[NAME\] reminding you that when you \#SlowTheSpread, you slow the sickness. Help our \#HealthcareHeroes treat more sick, more slowly. Now take this message and pass it on: spread the word, not the germ.
