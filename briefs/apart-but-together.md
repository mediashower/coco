## Shoot a video:

_No fancy set. No hair and makeup. No need to memorize. Just turn the camera on yourself \(in landscape mode\) and read one of these lines:_

* Hi, this is \[NAME\] reminding you that we are socially distancing but we're closer than ever. We are \#TogetherApart. Now take this message and pass it on: spread the word, not the germ. 
* \[NAME\] here. _\[Talk about any way that you've reached out to someone else during the \#Coronacrisis\]_ Remember that we are \#TogetherApart. Spread the word, not the germ. 
* This is \[NAME\] and I want to share... _\[Talk about how someone has reached out to you in some meaningful way.\]_ Remember: we are \#TogetherApart. Spread the word, not the germ. 
* \[NAME\] here. _\[Any jokes, ironic observations, or funny ha-has about how we are more connected than ever.\]_ The irony is we are \#TogetherApart. Spread the word, not the germ.
