{% hint style="success" %}
The flu virus withers in sunlight: practice social distancing and common sense, but GET OUTSIDE. \#coco
{% endhint %}

## Why This is Important:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Helping the public understand that fresh air is good for mental and physical stimulation, BUT we must still practice all health precautions. \[Source: World Health Organization\]

_NOTE: This does NOT mean that sunshine kills Coronavirus! Please read the_ [_common misunderstandings on the WHO website_](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters)_, and communicate responsibly._
{% endhint %}

## Shoot a video:

_No fancy set. No hair and makeup. No need to memorize. Just turn the camera on yourself \(in landscape mode\) and read one of these lines:_

* This is \[NAME\] reminding you that sunshine is a powerful disinfectant. Practice social distancing and exercise common sense, but GET OUTSIDE. Now take this message and pass it on: spread the word, not the germ. 
* \[NAME\] here, reminding you that the flu virus withers under sunlight. Practice social distancing and exercise common sense, but GET OUTSIDE. Now take this message and pass it on: spread the word, not the germ. 
* I'm \[NAME\]. A little exercise is good for the body, mind, and spirit. Practice social distancing and common sense, but GET OUTSIDE and GET SOME \#SUNSHINE. Now take this message and pass it on: spread the word, not the germ. 
* This is \[NAME\] reminding you that sunshine doesn't kill \#Coronavirus, but it certainly doesn't hurt. Practice social distancing and common sense, but GET SOME \#SUNSHINE. 
* Hi, this is \[NAME\]. Soak up some \#sunshine. It's refreshing. _\[Note: even better if you're actually outdoors.\]_
