## Copy, paste, and post:

{% hint style="success" %}
There's no going back to life before \#Coronavirus, but we can work together to find a \#NewNormal. \#coco
{% endhint %}

## Why This is Important:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Helping people understand that this pandemic will mean significant change, but that humans are resilient and can find a \#NewNormal. \[Source: [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/outbreak-communication-best-practices-for-communicating-with-the-public-during-an-outbreak)\]
{% endhint %}

## Shoot a video:

_No fancy set. No hair and makeup. No need to memorize. Just turn the camera on yourself \(in landscape mode\) and read one of these lines:_

* This is \[NAME\] reminding you that there's no going back to life before \#Coronavirus, but the \#NewNormal might just be better than the Old Normal. Now take this message and pass it on: spread the word, not the germ 
* \[NAME\] here, reminding you to find a \#NewNormal. We're not going back to the old way, so do your best to get into a new routine. Now take this message and pass it on: spread the word, not the germ 
* This is \[NAME\]. _\[Share anything that shows how you are personally developing a new routine, developing new habits, or creating your own \#NewNormal.\]_ Spread the word, not the germ.

## PLEASE NOTE:

Avoid complaining about something that annoys you and tagging it \#NewNormal, unless that's really the way you want things to be.

## Use this hashtag:

{% hint style="success" %}
\#NewNormal
