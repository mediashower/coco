# Best Practices for Education

## Communicating about Health & Safety 

* **Be factual**. Only share information from reliable sources, such as the WHO and the CDC \(Examples: [Garden Grove Unified School District](https://ggusd.us/communication/coronavirus-update), [Seattle Public Schools](https://www.seattleschools.org/district/calendars/news/what_s_new/coronavirus_update), and [Pennsylvania School Boards Association](https://www.psba.org/advocacy-and-news/resources/coronavirus/)\).  
* **Be timely**. Share up-to-the-minute verified details \(Examples: [School District of Pickens County](http://www.pickens.k12.sc.us/about_us/what_s_new/schools_closed_due_to_coronavirus), [Baltimore County Public Schools](https://www.bcps.org/system/coronavirus/), and [Metropolitan School District Lawrence Township](https://www.ltschools.org/announcements/coronavirus-preparedness-%281%29)\).   
* **Be inclusive**. Remember that you're communicating to parents, students, teachers, maintenance staff, and the general public \(Examples: [Platte County School District](https://www.plattecountyschooldistrict.com/site/Default.aspx?PageID=4375), [Hudson Schools](https://hudsonraiders.org/2020/03/10/coronavirus-covid-19-update/), and [Bloomfield Hills Schools](https://www.bloomfield.org/about-us/safety-security/coronavirus-information)\).  

## Communicating about Remote Work and Online Classes

* **Set expectations**. Make it clear what you expect to happen during the remote work and online classes to minimize confusion \(Examples: [Fulton County Schools](https://www.fultonschools.org/remotelearning), [Hillsborough County Public Schools](https://www.sdhc.k12.fl.us/), and [Middletown Area School District](https://www.raiderweb.org/news/what_s_new/coronavirus_update_-_3_19_2020)\).  
* **Share resources**. Suggest developmentally-appropriate activities for parents to do with their kids while they're not in school \(Examples: [Principal Distance Learning Resources](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VipbmytyUVINjIQ2VsxS5zezVgsfUFJb), [International Educator Shared resources for Virtual Learning in Emergency School Closure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1szHdBo1cjIK6ww-CmlN8iCJ2O2H_2NSGi2Lgpycvn9I/edit?fbclid=IwAR0cfyKgml7INwo2Ceb2qVXmJ5oy_TSdtwhITundQo8odk7mAub8SLn_z60), and [Lansing School District](http://www.lansingschools.net/parents/learning-at-home/)\).  
* **Update often**. Teachers and instructors' plans will likely change - keep students and parents up to date when that happens \(Example: [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/teaching/topics/teaching-and-learning-when-classes-cant-meet/), [Humanizing Online Teaching from St. Mary's College of California](https://digitalcommons.stmarys-ca.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2804&amp;context=school-education-faculty-works), and [Binghamton University](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2314/binghamton-university-moves-online-in-response-to-coronavirus-best-practices-for-adapting-your-course)\).  

## Communicating to Students

* **Centralize communication.** Create a hub for crisis communications so that it's all in one place and easy to find \(Examples: [Fairfax County Public Schools](https://www.fcps.edu/news/coronavirus-update), [Montana State University](https://www.montana.edu/health/coronavirus/archived-comms.html), and [Elon University](https://www.elon.edu/u/coronavirus/)\).
* **Communicate clearly**. Make it easy for everyone to understand what's going on \(Examples: [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/virusinfo), [Arizona State University](https://eoss.asu.edu/health/announcements/coronavirus), and [University of Denver](https://www.du.edu/coronavirus)\).   
* **Offer support**. It's a scary time for everyone. Explain to your students where they can get help \(Examples: [Fulton County Schools](https://www.fultonschools.org/coronavirus), [The University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/coronavirus-covid-19-information), and [Meredith College](https://www.meredith.edu/coronavirus)\).  



## Communicating about Disaster and Continuity Planning 

* **Be specific**. Give information about what's going to happen and when \(Examples: [Harvard University](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/11/harvard-coronavirus-bacow-announcement/), [Brockenhurst College](https://www.brock.ac.uk/coronavirus-contingency-action-plan/), and [The Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction](https://www.k12.wa.us/sites/default/files/public/communications/COVID-19%20in%20Schools_Parent%20Guide.pdf)\).          
* **Communicate often**. When you have new information to share, put it out there \(Examples: [Ottawa-Carleton District School Board](https://ocdsb.ca/our_schools/novel_coronavirus_information_for_parents), [School District of Osceola County, Florida](https://www.osceolaschools.net/news/newsroom/coronavirus_information_for_parents_and_students), and [Pulaski County School District](https://www.roanoke.com/news/education/school-systems-prepare-coronavirus-contingency-plans/article_def68700-3f29-575a-99e2-a5f821837192.html)\).   
* **Increase available resources**. During times of crisis, make more resources available to those who need them most \(Examples: [Holyoke Community College](https://www.hcc.edu/student-life/caring-for-yourself/coronavirus/academic-continuity-plan), [Fox Chapel Area School District,](https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2020/03/10/fox-chapel-area-school-district-coronavirus-contingency-plan/) and [Miami-Dade County Public Schools](https://www.wlrn.org/post/miami-dade-schools-prepares-online-learning-plan-case-coronavirus-school-closures)\).  

## Communicating about Helping Your Community 

* **Be accurate**. Share information that's been vetted by experts \(Examples: [New York Department of Health and New York State Department of Education](http://www.p12.nysed.gov/sss/schoolhealth/schoolhealthservices/coronavirus/covid-19-p-12-school-guidance.pdf), [Traverse Bay Area Intermediate School District](https://www.tbaisd.org/services/communication-services/covid-19-coronavirus-information/), and [Alamo Colleges District](https://www.alamo.edu/coronavirus/)\).
* **Show compassion**. In challenging situations, demonstrate you care about your students, teachers, staffers, and the community at large \(Examples: [Folsom Cordova Unified School District](https://www.fcusd.org/coronavirus), [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/covid-19-moving-classes-online-other-updates), and [Forest Hills School District](https://www.foresthills.edu/how-do-i/health-wellness-resources/coronavirus-updates.html)\).  
* **Empower audiences**. Encourage your audience to take the right steps to prevent exposure and reduce panic \(Examples: [Clear Creek Amana Community School District](https://www.ccaschools.org/Page/5415), [University of Nevada Reno](https://www.unr.edu/nevada-today/news/2020/university-update-regarding-the-novel-coronavirus), and [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu/coronavirus/info.php)\).
