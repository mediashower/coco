# Best Practices for Healthcare

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/yvmWKOOAC1A" %}

## Communicating about Health & Safety \(to Employees\)

* **Get back to basics.** Promote rigorous attention to infection control basics.

  ·         Example: [Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-03/sfhe-hks030420.php)

*  **Sharing is caring.** Share other healthcare systems' "lessons learned."

  ·         Example: [Evergreen Health, Kirkland, WA](http://www.wsha.org/wp-content/uploads/2020-3-12-EvergreenHealth-WSHA_COVID19_TO-SHARE.pdf)\*\*\*\*

* **Teach resourcefulness.** Educate employees on optimizing PPE supplies in conventional, contingency, and crisis scenarios.

  ·         Example: [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/isolation-gowns.html)

## Communicating about Health & Safety \(to Patients\)

*  **Provide telemedicine options.** Encourage patients to use telemedicine for convenience and social distancing.

  ·         Example: [Modern Healthcare](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/opinion-editorial/congress-must-act-ensure-telehealth-can-be-used-combat-coronavirus?utm_source=modern-healthcare-daily-dose&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=20200302&utm_content=article5-headline)

* **Think before you tweet.** Use social media responsibly, to democratize accurate COVID-19 facts.

  ·         Example: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/public-health-communicators-get-your-community-ready.html)\*\*\*\*

* **Educate, identify, and treat.** Employ a three-pronged "educate, identify, treat" strategy to help patients understand symptoms and next steps.

  ·         Example: [Luma Health](https://www.lumahealth.io/blog/coronavirus-patient-communication-best-practices/)\*\*\*\*

## Communicating Operational Changes to Patients 

* **Think GMB.** Update your Google My Business listing and your web pages if your operating hours or locations change.

  ·         Example: [Search Engine Land](https://searchengineland.com/update-your-online-presence-for-covid-19-330968)\*\*\*\*

* **Put your auto-attendant to work.** Update your recorded auto-attendant phone greeting, informing patients about what information you need, when they can expect a response, and why your office cannot personally pick up all calls at this time.

  ·         Example: [HubSpot](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-voicemail-tips-that-guarantee-callbacks)\*\*\*\*

* **Tweet and chat.** Use social media posts to inform patients of changes to operating conditions, including changes in hours and changes in how to access healthcare.

  ·         Example: [AMA](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/doctor-uses-reach-social-media-ease-covid-19-pandemic-fears)

## Communicating about Disaster and Continuity Planning 

* **Be clear.** Provide employees with clear steps they should follow to help ensure business continuity. Make these steps as unambiguous as possible to minimize chances of misinterpretation

  ·         Example: [LogicGate](https://www.logicgate.com/2020/03/09/business-continuity-plans-and-covid-19-a-primer/)\*\*\*\*

* **Be secure.** Use a password-protected page on your company website to communicate with employees if you must implement your crisis plan. You could also designate a toll-free phone number for employees to call for information or use secure mass text messaging

  ·         Example: [RISCPA](https://www.riscpa.org/news-and-events/165/covid-19-business-planning-checklist/view-news)\*\*\*\*

* **Pin posts.** Create pinned posts and tweets on your business social media pages to inform patients about practice continuity. Pinned elements stay at the top of your business page.

  ·         Examples: [Facebook](https://m.facebook.com/help/235598533193464?helpref=related&source_cms_id=1376303972644600), Twitter

## Communicating about Helping Your Community 

* **Know your POC**. Establish a point of contact between your healthcare system and local government to ensure coordination during quarantine periods.

  ·         Example: [CDC](https://app.gitbook.com/@media-shower/s/coco/~/drafts/-M31XzUTW28oCSYPXNP2/best-practices/best-practices-for-healthcare)

* **Reach out.** Communicate with local faith-based organizations to emphasize the need for social distancing.

  ·         Example: [Minnesota Department of Health](https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/coronavirus/action.html#faith)\*\*\*\*

* **Coordinate care work**. Work with community leaders to coordinate checking in on vulnerable populations sheltering at home.

  ·         Example: [Canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/vulnerable-populations-covid-19.html)
