**Communicating about Health & Safety** 

* **Encourage employees to stay home whenever possible during this crisis.**
  * **Example:** This [tweet](https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1237499299589582848?s=20) from Google CEO Sundar Pichai strikes the right tone.

* **Communicate more, not less.** 
  * This is not the time for radio silence. 
  * Frequent communication will lessen anxiety. 
  * **Example:** [_Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute COVID-19 Latest Updates_](https://covid19.rpi.edu/communications)\_\_
* **Be transparent but positiveâ€”even when the news is bad.**
  * **Example:** [_ChicagoPolice Twitter feed_](https://twitter.com/AJGuglielmi/status/1241843627254398982?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1241843627254398982&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2Fworld%2Flive-news%2Fcoronavirus-outbreak-03-22-20%2Findex.html)\*\*\*\*

## Communicating about Remote Work

* **Practice remote leadership.**
  * Business leadership must be "seen" regularly in online communication channels. 
  * Show your human side, be approachable.
  * Encourage and praise workers.
  * **Example:** [_Taco Bell Twitter \#DriveThruHeroes_](https://twitter.com/tacobell/status/1241229011319169024)\_\_
  * **Example:** [_Thank God for our nurses, doctors, and all first responders._](https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1239335925202784257?s=20)\_\_
* **Establish work/life balance.**
  * Encourage workers to go offline when the workday is done.
  * **Example:** [_Challenges to Managing Virtual Teams and How to Overcome Them_](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/professional-development/blog/challenges-managing-virtual-teams-and-how-overcome-them)\_\_
