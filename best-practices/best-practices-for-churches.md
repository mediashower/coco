# Best Practices for Churches

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/YZ7pU53Y7aI" %}

## Communicating about Health & Safety 

* **Put health first:** Let worshipers know they can partake in meaningful prayer and receive spiritual guidance and community support even while practicing social distancing. \(Examples: [Ohr Kodesh Congregation](http://ohrkodesh.org/), [First Baptist Church,](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/coronavirus/article241279411.html) [ADAMS Center](https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2020/03/13/dilemma-facing-religious-leaders-when-close-doors-during-pandemic/).\)
* **Change with the times**: Much is still unknown about the virus that causes COVID-19, and that means changes and new discoveries are made daily. Update your recommendations, closures and other practices in keeping with the best and timeliest advice available from the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the like. \(Examples: [Union Temple of Brooklyn](https://uniontemple.org/infopost/ut-covid-19-information-synagogue-closure-live-streaming/), [Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center](https://hijrah.org/), [Washington National Cathedral](https://cathedral.org/).\)
* **Communicate reasons for closure:** Despite its inarguable and quick spread across the globe, more than a third of Americans still don't see the coronavirus "as a real threat," according to a [recent poll.](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/17/816501871/poll-as-coronavirus-spreads-fewer-americans-see-pandemic-as-a-real-threat) So even if you think it's obvious, communicate the health-based reasons for your closure, truncated schedule or 100% temporary move to cyberspace. \(Examples: [Bender JCC](https://www.benderjccgw.org/covid-19/), [MAS DC Community Center](https://www.masdc.org/).\) 

## Communicating about Event and Services Cancellations

* **Update early and often:** In this time of fear and uncertainty \(and a lot of working from home\), those lucky enough to be online are checking in [more than ever](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/technology/coronavirus-how-to-live-online.html). Since that's the case, update your website frequently to let your community know the new status of events and services previously or usually on your calendar. \(Examples: [Beth El Hebrew Congregation](https://www.bethelhebrew.org/), [Saint Andrew Apostle Catholic Church](https://standrewapostle.org/message-from-father-dan/), [St. Luke's Episcopal Church](https://www.stlukesbethesda.org/).\)   
* **When in doubt, send out a mass email:** Some segments of your congregation or organization may not remember to check your website, but they're still [likely to check their email](https://optinmonster.com/email-marketing-vs-social-media-performance-2016-2019-statistics/). Whenever there's been a development affecting your worship times or programming, send out an email blast to members to let them know. \(Examples: [Congregation Ahavas Achim](https://www.jta.org/2020/03/13/united-states/american-jews-brace-for-a-shabbat-like-no-other), [Bethel Church](https://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/living/religion/article241044316.html), [Central Assembly](https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2020/03/13/local-churches-take-precautions-cancel-services-amid-covid-19-virus/5044234002/).\)
* **Pick up the phone:** A telephone call to let those congregants or members who are not online know about your current schedule could save them a lot of headache. \(Examples: [Wilson Temple](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/churches-coronavirus-services.html), [Sardis Baptist Church](https://www.scnow.com/news/local/social-distancing-canceled-services-hit-pee-dee-churches/article_54c5582e-ed22-59f4-aa87-85485b6731b8.html).\)

## Communicating to Members

* **Post on social media:** Let your members or congregants know you haven't forgotten them or their spiritual needs by regularly posting relevant and/or uplifting content to your organization or house of worship's social-media accounts. \([Sixth & I Historic Synagogue](https://twitter.com/SixthandI?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), [Diocese of Brooklyn](https://www.instagram.com/dioceseofbrooklyn/?hl=en), [Islamic Community Center of Long Island](https://twitter.com/icliny?lang=en).\) 
* **Livestream:** If you haven't done so already, consider moving live sermons online, when and where possible. This can help congregants maintain some sense of normalcy when they cannot worship as they usually do. \([St. Patrick's Cathedral](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/tech/religious-services-livestream/index.html), [Diocese of Allentown](https://www.ad-today.com/live/).\)
* **Reach out:** If it's feasible and you have the time and personnel resources, consider picking up the phone or sending text messages to check in on individual congregants or members. \([New Northside Missionary Baptist](https://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/st-louis-black-churches-consider-ways-keep-congregants-safe-midst-coronavirus#stream/0), [Wheaton College](https://www.wheaton.edu/media/humanitarian-disaster-institute/Preparing-Your-Church-for-Coronavirus.pdf).\)

## Communicating about Helping Your Community	

* **Post opportunities to help:** The national mood may not be cheery, but many people are still eager to help where aid is needed. Use your organization or house of worship's webpage to post information about volunteer opportunities, be they grocery shopping for the elderly or gathering and donating food, clothing or other supplies for those in need. \([Sunset Church](https://www.sunsetchurchsf.org/news-list/corona-virus-response), [Boulder JCC](https://www.boulderjcc.org/index.php?src=gendocs&ref=Support%20Our%20Community), [United Methodist Church of the Resurrection](https://cor.org/leawood/localimpact/in-kind-donations).\)
* **Offer an email:** If you'd rather not post opportunities publicly, ask that volunteers come to you. On your organization's website, post an email address or phone number through which volunteer-opportunity information can be obtained. \([Congregation Beth Israel](https://www.jewishforsyth.org/), [Isaac Agree Downtown Synagogue](https://www.downtownsynagogue.org/volunteer-1), [Christ Church Georgetown](https://www.christchurchgeorgetown.org/).\)
* **Take up a collection:** Consider becoming a clearinghouse for monetary donations that will go toward helping those with the coronavirus. \([Boys and Girls Clubs of America](https://www.bgca.org/about-us/child-safety/Boys-Girls-Clubs-Response-to-COVID-19), [Rolling Hills Covenant Church.\) ](https://www.dailybreeze.com/2020/03/21/rolling-hills-congregation-donates-supplies-money-to-aid-seniors-amid-coronavirus-crisis/)
