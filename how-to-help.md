# How to Help

It's pretty simple. **Help us spread these messages, faster than the virus.**

On the left, you'll find our "CoCo Briefs," packed with plenty of tweets, images, and memes. Share them across blogs, social media, video. Get creative. Surprise us. [SAVE FERRIS](https://www.google.com/search?q=save+ferris+bueller&source=lnms&tbm=isch).

This is not a "feel-good" or charity project. This is important work, because it helps educate the public on how to think and act during a global pandemic. It's cute and funny, but _this is no joke_.

**Start by sharing a single message**. Your voice is stronger than you think.

_It's never too late to \#SlowTheSpread. It's never too late to see \#HumansHelpingHumans. When we work together, we win. \#coco_
{% endhint %}



## How to Help Even More

If you're creative, CoCo has a hundred ways to help. Everything on this site is open source \(copyright-free\), so you're free to build, remix, and share. 

* **Marketing peeps** can write catchy headlines and slogans around these messages.
* **Graphic designers** can create branded images and banners \(think [Hope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_%22Hope%22_poster), [We Can Do It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Can_Do_It!), and [Keep Calm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Calm_and_Carry_On)\). 
* **Social media influencers** can help amplify these messages \(or translate into other languages\).
* **Video creators** can create and share videos that build on these messages.
* **Meme creators** can build and share viral memes to slow the virus.

### During a pandemic, you don't need to ask permission: just do the right thing.

We are a small team of marketing and communication professionals working on a volunteer basis. CoCo is a labor of love.

At the same time, we welcome **government, institutional, or corporate grants** to help us amplify this global communication effort. [Contact us if you can help](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnhargrave/).
