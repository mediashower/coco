# How to Help

The primary way you can help is by spreading the messages in each of our CoCo briefs, listed at left. Share them across blogs, social media, video, email blasts. Get creative. Surprise us.

We are also looking for volunteers with specific skill sets:

**1\) Communications and PR pros:** We need help creating CoCo Briefs. Ideal candidates will have experience writing highly successful campaign briefs. Gifted **copywriters** are also welcome.

**2\) Tweet writers:** We need social media experts who can churn out a tweetload of catchy viral messages. We desperately need **social media influencers** to amplify those messages.

**3\) Meme creators:** Memes are tricky to get right, so we need people who both understand the medium and can stay on message. Gifted **meme curators** are also welcome.

**4\) Smart researchers:** We need help curating **best practices** with how people are communicating with businesses, communities, churches, schools, and governments. You need writing and GitHub.

**5\) Funding:** We are a small team of volunteers, doing this as we can. We welcome government, institutional, or corporate grants, which will greatly amplify this global communication effort.
