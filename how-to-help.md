# How to Help

The primary way you can help is by **spreading the messages** in each of our CoCo briefs, listed at left. Share them across blogs, social media, video. Get creative. Surprise us. [SAVE FERRIS](https://www.google.com/search?q=save+ferris+bueller).

We are also looking for volunteers with specific skill sets:

**1\) Communications and PR pros:** We need help creating CoCo Briefs. Ideal candidates will have experience writing highly successful campaign briefs. Gifted **copywriters** are also welcome.

**2\) Tweet writers:** We need social media experts who can churn out a tweetload of catchy viral messages. We desperately need **social media influencers** to amplify those messages.

**3\) Meme creators:** Memes are tricky to get right, so we need people who both understand the medium and can stay on message. Gifted **meme curators** are also welcome.

**4\) Graphic designers:** We need help curating **branded images and graphics** \(think [Hope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_%22Hope%22_poster), [We Can Do It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Can_Do_It!), [Keep Calm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Calm_and_Carry_On), etc.\). You will literally be designing the images that will shape history.

**5\) Funding:** We are a small team of volunteers, doing the best we can. We welcome government, institutional, or corporate grants, which will greatly amplify this global communication effort.
