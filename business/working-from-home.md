# Working From Home

## Primary Message:

_Strive for a one-sentence message that is clear, actionable, and inspiring._

{% hint style="success" %}
While working from home, there are "hacks" you can use to keep yourself productive, which is important in the fight against COVID-19.
{% endhint %}

## Message Points:

_5-10 message points that can be used as "springboards" for blog posts and social media._

* As much as possible, keep your normal work routine.
* Get up at the same hour. Start and stop your work at the same hour.
* Keep yourself looking good. Aim for "dressy casual."
* Learn how to use videoconference tools. Upgrade your video space.
* Try to keep your workspace noise-free and distraction-free, as best you can.
* Keep regular team meetings by videoconference. Consider "Monday morning kickoffs."
* Consider standing one-on-one videoconferences with each team member as well.
* As best you can, continue "business as usual." 
* Consider donating 10-20% of your time to how your business can help others in this time.
