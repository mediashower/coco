# Communication Cheat Sheet

This isn't the first time humans have faced a pandemic.

Fortunately, many smart people have spent many years putting together best practices on how to communicate to the public. We've pulled together their recommendations into these **quick tips** that you can share with your team. 

### Think of this as your **communication playbook**. 

* **Be consistent**: During times of pandemic, messages work best when they are consistent and coherent. 
* **Go public quickly**: Even if you have incomplete information. Adjust as things change. Be agile.
* **Don’t wait for the press release.** Try to get it out as soon as you can, as best you can.
* **Be honest**: Say what you know, what you don’t know, and what you’re doing. 
* **No BS:** Be easily understood, complete, and free from deceit.
* **Be clear**. Eliminate jargon. Use plain, simple language. Be accessible to a non-technical audience.
* **Be calm.** Resist the urge to say "Don't panic" or "Stay calm." Instead, BE reassuring and BE calm.
* **Be flexible**: Explain that the information may change when you know more.
* **Be careful.** Avoid being confident with tenuous information. 
* **Speak to the fear**: Recognize that people will be frightened. Put these fears into words, then address them openly, regardless of how unfounded or unscientific the fears may seem.
* **LISTEN:** Talk with your target audience. Talk with their key opinion leaders about what they're hearing in the community. Keep your ear to the ground and your finger on the pulse. 
* **Keep talking**. Then communicate, again and again. Promise timely, regular   updates. Then deliver.
