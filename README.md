# An Intro to CoCo

During the COVID-19 pandemic, one thing we can all do is **communicate well about Coronavirus**.

![Coronavirus + Communication = CoCo.](.gitbook/assets/coco-logo-wide%20%281%29.png)

CoCo is a **messaging toolkit** with ready-made tweets, images, and even memes that you’re free to use, remix, and share. Get creative!

We've created CoCo to empower **anyone with an audience** to spread helpful, truthful information -- through blogs, videos, and social media.

## **Start sharing now:**

`By spreading helpful, truthful messages about #COVID19, we can #SlowTheSpread and speed the #GreatRecovery. This is how we band together as humans to defeat the #Coronavirus.`

`We all have an audience, and we all have a voice. Your voice is stronger than you think. #coco`

`Do something kind today for someone else. Do a #CoCo`
{% endhint %}

Good communication is how we work together as humans. We’re one human species. And if we work together, we will win.

Only by working together will we be able to defeat COVID-19. This is literally **your chance to save the world.**

## **How you can help \(right now\)**

Each CoCo Brief \(at left\) has a **primary message** with talking points, tweets, and images to help these ideas spread. Put them in your blogs and social media feeds ... or just tell a friend. 

**Your mission**: help these messages spread faster than the virus.
{% endhint %}

We have a **once-in-a-lifetime opportunity** to save humanity and rebuild the world in a better way.

### Spread the word. Not the germ. Do a \#CoCo.
