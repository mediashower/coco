# An Intro to CoCo

During the COVID-19 pandemic, one thing we can all do is **communicate well about Coronavirus**.

![Coronavirus + Communication = CoCo.](.gitbook/assets/coco-logo-wide.png)

We've created CoCo to empower **anyone with an audience** to spread helpful, truthful information -- through blogs, videos, social media, and email blasts.

{% hint style="success" %}
## **Start sharing now:**

`By spreading helpful, truthful messages about #COVID19, we can #SlowTheSpread and speed the #GreatRecovery. This is how we band together as humans to defeat the #Coronavirus.`

`We all have an audience, and we all have a voice. Your voice is stronger than you think. #coco`

`Do something kind today for someone else. Do a #CoCo`
{% endhint %}

CoCo is a **messaging toolkit** with ready-made tweets, images, and even memes that you're free to use, remix, translate and share. Get creative!

Only by working together will we be able to defeat COVID-19. This is literally **your chance to save the world.**

## **How you can help \(right now\)**

Each CoCo Brief \(at left\) has a **primary message** with talking points, images and memes to help these ideas spread. Put them in your blogs and social media feeds ... or just tell a friend. 

**Your mission**: help these messages spread faster than the virus.
{% endhint %}

We have a **once-in-a-lifetime opportunity** to save humanity and rebuild the world in a better way.

### Spread the word. Not the virus. Do a \#CoCo.
