# An Intro to CoCo

During the COVID-19 pandemic, one thing we can all do is **communicate well about Coronavirus**.

**Co**ronavirus + **Co**mmunication = CoCo.

We've created the CoCo Briefs to empower **anyone with an audience** to spread positive, helpful, truth-based information -- through blogs, videos, social media, and email blasts.

{% hint style="success" %}
## **Everyone Can Help**

We need to get these messages to everyone, in the places they consume media, in the way people communicate today. This is how we band together as humans to defeat the virus.

We all have an audience, and we all have a voice. Your voice is stronger than you think.
{% endhint %}

In this "decentralized media" approach, we all become our own mini-broadcasting outlet, spreading these positive messages to counter fear and ignorance about COVID-19.

{% hint style="warning" %}
## **How This Works**

Each CoCo Brief has a **primary message**, 5-10 **messaging points** that you can use in your blogs and social media, and various **images and memes** to help these ideas spread.

Your mission: help these messages spread faster than the virus.
