# CoCo: COVID-19 Communication Briefs

During the COVID-19 \(Coronavirus\) outbreak, one thing we can all do to help is **communicate well**.

We've created the CoCo Briefs to empower **anyone with an audience** to spread positive, helpful, truth-based information -- through blogs, videos, social media, and email blasts.

{% hint style="warning" %}
### **How This Works**

Each CoCo Brief has a **primary message**, 5-10 **messaging points** that you can use in your blogs and social media, and various **images and memes** that can help these ideas spread. 

Your mission: help these messages spread faster than the virus.
{% endhint %}

In this "decentralized media" approach, we all become our own mini-broadcasting outlet, spreading these positive messages to counter fear and ignorance about COVID-19.

{% hint style="success" %}
### **Everyone Can Help**

We need to get these messages to everyone, in the places they consume media, in the way people communicate today. This is the way we band together as humans to defeat the virus.

We all have an audience, and we all have a voice. Your voice is stronger than you think.
{% endhint %}

Everything here is **free to share**. We encourage you to translate it into your local languages, make it accessible to everyone \(especially those in need\), and find fun and creative ways to make it go viral.

Everything here is also a **work in progress**. We ask for contributions and improvements, which you can make using a [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/mediashower/coco) or emailing us at info@mediashower.com.

COVID-19 is the virus. Information is the antivirus.
