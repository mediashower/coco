# An Intro to CoCo

During the Coronacrisis, one thing we can all do is communicate well about Coronavirus**. When we share helpful, truthful information, we literally save lives.** That's why we created CoCo.

CoCo is a **messaging toolkit** with ready-made tweets, images, and even memes that you’re free to use, remix, and share. They're cute and funny, but the mission is serious: _you're saving human lives._

We've created CoCo to empower **anyone with an audience** to spread helpful, truthful information -- through blogs, videos, and social media. You can start sharing right now.

_During the \#Coronacrisis, we can all do something to help. Help, don't hoard. Build, don't blame. Your voice is stronger than you think. \#coco_

Good communication is how we work together as humans. We’re one human species. And if we work together, we will win.

When we argue, fight, bicker, and blame, the virus marches on. Only by working together will we be able to defeat COVID-19. This is literally **your chance to save lives.**

## **How you can help \(right now\)**

Each CoCo Brief \(at left\) has a primary message with talking points, tweets, and images to help these ideas spread. **Copy, paste, and post** into your blogs and social media feeds. Boost. Amplify. Forward to a friend. 

**Your mission**: help these messages spread faster than the virus.
{% endhint %}

We have a **once-in-a-lifetime opportunity** to save human lives, and rebuild the world in a better way.
