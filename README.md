# CoCo: COVID-19 Communication Briefs

During the COVID-19 \(Coronavirus\) outbreak, one thing we can all do is communicate well.

We've created the CoCo Briefs to empower everyone to spread positive, helpful, truth-based information -- whether through your blog, video, or social media.

In this "decentralized media" approach, we all become our own mini-broadcasting outlet, spreading and propagating these positive messages to counter the fear which is our greater enemy.

Everything here is free of charge and free of copyright. We encourage you to translate it into your local languages, make it accessible to the disabled, and find fun and creative ways to make it go viral.

COVID-19 is the virus. Information is the antivirus.
